<h1>All About Fish</h1>
Fish are facinating animals that live under the
<a href="http://www.ocean.com/">sea</a>.
They have <a href="http://www.fish.ocean.com/scales/scale.1.jpg">scales</a>
and <a href="http://marinebiology.org/fins//fin-0.GIF">fins</a>.<br> There are many good
<a href="http://www.seafood-recipes.com/directory/salmon.asp">recipes</a> to cook fish.<br>
Fish make excellent <a href="http://www.petfish.net/index.php">pets</a>,
and many people are interested in <a href="http://www.tropfish.com">tropical fish</a>.
My favorite fish-related website is http://www.fish.com/tropical.<br>
Some people think that "http://fish/fish.html" would be a good URL, but they are wrong!
Others think that starfish should have a URL of "http://fish.com/*fish" but that's bad too!
